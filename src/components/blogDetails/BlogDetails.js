                customers. While some companies are ready to sign up for the
                anticipated RPC service at launch, others will be excited to
                discover an additional new Ankr service available on Azure that

                While Ankr’s Enterprise RPC Service offers global, low-latency
                blockchain connections, Ankr’s partnership with Microsoft will
                now also provide access to the AppChains product. Ankr AppChains
                is a solution that gives enterprises the opportunity to quickly
                launch their own dedicated and fully customizable blockchain to
                power their Web3 strategies. The service is also offered on
                Azure Marketplace alongside the Enterprise RPC solution, with
                the first iteration enabling enterprises to deploy their own
                Polygon Supernets, and the choice of many more ecosystems on the
                way.

              <h2>Launching A Dedicated Blockchain Made Easy</h2>
              <p>
                Ankr’s AppChains product has already been available for a year,
                allowing Web3 organizations to launch scalable
                application-specific blockchains to power their decentralized
                apps or projects in a highly automated process. However, the
                popularity of AppChains with traditional enterprises has made
                them an attractive choice for launching a variety of solutions
                that pertain to institutional clients, banking, CBDCs, gaming,
                and much more. Often, traditional firms look to trusted outlets
                to discover new technology. Making the AppChain solution
                available on Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace provides an easy path
                for businesses to find a vetted solution and go to market with
                use cases like the above.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ankr’s AppChains remove some of the largest roadblocks companies
                face when deciding to launch a Web3 initiative: scalability,
                user experience, and cost of acquiring new Web3 engineering
                talent. AppChains ensure fast and affordable transactions,
                seamless user experiences, regulatory compliance, and end-to-end
                engineering from Ankr’s proven engineering team. Benefits like
                these help to ensure a smooth and simplified transition to Web3
                for companies who have been waiting to become involved in the
                digital asset space for some time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AppChain solution on the Azure Marketplace will allow
                customers to choose custom specifications for their blockchain
                as well as their Web3 application at every level. With a base
                level of infrastructure, including validator nodes, RPC nodes,
                testnet faucet, block explorer, as well as additional indexer
                nodes, Advanced APIs, and bridges, companies can design and
                complete their Enterprise Blockchain quickly. With an assortment
                of additional features, they can launch their application or use
                case on top of it with the highest level of Web3 user
                experience. Features such as in-app wallets, fiat on/offramps,
                and bridge solutions create an extremely easy experience for
                users so enterprises can open the gates to all customers, even
                those unfamiliar with Web3 processes.
