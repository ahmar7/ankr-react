            Web3 is a smarter internet â€” it incorporates new tech like
            blockchain systems that enable us to disrupt the intermediaries and
            gatekeepers that have dominated the web (and the world) so far. This
            gives us an opportunity to democratize services across the board,
            from finance to data storage.

              Every blockchain use case requires access to nodes. Ankr provides
              streamlined access to our global network of nodes running on 18
              different blockchains. This greatly simplifies the process of
              building, operating, and maintaining all the decentralized
              applications of the new web.
